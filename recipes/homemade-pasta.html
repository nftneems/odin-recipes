    <h1>Homemade Pasta</h1>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled</li>        
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p>Start by making a mound of the flour directly on the countertop. Make a deep crater in the top and add the eggs, olive oil, and salt.</p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p>Use a fork to break up the eggs without breaking through the walls of your mound.Try to keep the eggs contained but it's not problem if they break. Use a spatula or bench scraper to work them back in. Work more flour into the eggs a little at a time. Drizzle 2 tbsp of <em>cold water</em> across the mixture and keep mixing until you've got a dough coming together</p>

    <p><em>Tip: One of the best ways to add water to fresh pasta dough is by spray bottle. You don't want the dough too wet.</em></p>
    <p>Step 3</p>
    <p>Use your hands to bring the dough together into a bag and knead for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is silky smooth and elastic.<em>See picture below for reference</em></p>

    <h3><em>How To Roll and Cut Fresh Pasta by Hand</em></h3>
    The average person <em>probably</em> doesn't have a pasta maker around the house so this is how you get that slice of italy by hand. To roll out pasta dough by hand, make sure your dough is at room temperature. Cut the dough into four equal pieces. Choose one piece to work with, and immediately wrap the rest so they don’t dry out. You'll need a floured surface, and you'll want to keep the pasta floured a bit as well, so it doesn't stick to itself. If the dough is sticking rub with a bit more flour. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to your desired thickness. I tend to go thinner than I think I’ll want because the pasta swells a bit as it cooks. Once you’ve rolled the dough out flat, to cut the dough into fettuccine (or whatever width you like), loosely fold/roll the dough into a cylinder, and cut with a sharp knife.</p>
    <p>Transfer the cut pasta to a floured baking sheet, swirled into little nests. Repeat with the remaining dough.</p>

    <h3><em>Cook Your Pasta</em></h3>
    <p>When you’re ready to cook the pasta do it in a large pot of well-salted water. Depending on the thickness and shape of your pasta, this might just take a minute or so. Pasta made with a high percentage of semolina flour or whole-grain flours will take a bit longer to cook than pasta made with “00” flour. Reserve a cup or two of the pasta water (in case you want to use it for a sauce), drain the pasta, and use immediately.</p>
